                        My name is Dries Verreydt. I am 30 years old and recently moved to the city of <em>Leuven</em>. I’m
                        originally from <em>Balen</em>, a small village in the north of Belgium. The region is called Kempen and
                        it’s known for being very green and rural. I moved to Leuven because I liked my time here studying
                        and currently prefer the city setting over a rural one. Also it is very convenient for working in
                        the region and Brussels having access to well setup public transport. I prefer the city because
                        everything is nearby, stores,  entertainment, people. Sometimes I do miss the greener areas in my
                        old town, but the city parks in and near Leuven are a very good substitute.

                        Programming wise I have a Bachelor in Applied Informatics from UCLL Leuven. During my education I
                        experimented with plenty of languages and frameworks but most of my projects I made in <em>Java</em> which
                        is where I have more of my experience so far. Initially I preferred back end programming making
                        cool algorithms to solve simple problems. Now I prefer more front end development where I can get
                        a quick visual result and feedback from users actually using my code for improvement. Visualisation
                        of data has also fascinated me, creating functional art from data to come to new insights and
                        conclusions is a marvellous thing.

                    <p>
                        In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and series and casually exercising.
                        Gaming wise I especially am fond of the MMORPG genre, having vast new worlds to explore and conquer
                        with online communities keeps me busy. I enjoy hanging out with people from all over the world with
                        different backgrounds to work together and solve problems.

                        My preferred video content is for sure sci-fi and fantasy. Recently my favourite content  revolves
                        around near future technology and usually self-aware AI  or robots. Superhero movies and series
                        definitely get me excited, I closely follow most new Marvel content. Sometimes I also watch anime
                        but it heavily depends on the series whether I like it or not, most mainstream anime I like though.
                        The latest series I am watching is Squid game, a Korean show about a high stakes game show where
                        children’s games are being played.

                        When I’m looking for a more interactive live experience I watch my favourite streamers on <em>Twitch</em>.
                        Usually in the background when I do other things. Whether it be reality TV or instructional streams
                        I like streamed content as a good distraction.

                    <p>
                        When the weather allows I like walks in the city and visiting nearby parks and interesting places.
                        I try to stay in shape a bit by going for casual jogs when I have the time also. Sports wise I
                        enjoy watching top level football as I used to play myself. Most other sports can’t really grasp me.
