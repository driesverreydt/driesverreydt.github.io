                I am quite interested in cryptography. Mostly simplistic concepts and puzzles for example the keyword
                cipher.  A keyword cipher is where you take a word with no recurring letters and put that in front of the
                remaining letters of the alphabet. If the keyword is ‘kryptos’ the encrypted alphabet would be
            <p>
            <p class="centeredtext">‘K R Y P T O S A B C D E F G H I J L M N Q U V W X Z’</p>
            <p>You then apply a letter substitution for every
                letter from the regular alphabet to this one. I used this concept in a puzzle that was nested in the game
                Fallout 76 to decode nuclear codes that where required to reach the end game. I definitely enjoy sharing my
                knowledge and passion so as I was one of the first to figure this out I even wrote a
                <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaUl4-kVH53KdwAvBBWvnETBby6R98pAF0iIvgPsogE/edit?usp=sharing'
                   target='_blank'>Fallout 76 decryption guide</a>
                for players to follow if they wanted to decode for themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is one of the examples why I really enjoy programming because setting up a program can help solve
                these complex problems with ease. More complex cryptography algorithms are interesting too but when it
                comes to the encryption we use in current day software it gets a bit too advanced to have fun with them
                for simple puzzle purposes.
